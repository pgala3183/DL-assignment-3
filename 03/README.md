## Objective
This implementation fundamentally maps the standard industry framework deployments modeling complete Deep Neural object architectures natively resolving identical 3-variable continuous nonlinear targets utilizing standard `torch.nn.Module` configurations.

## Architecture Description
The configuration relies seamlessly utilizing inherited PyTorch components securely encapsulating dense layers implicitly:
- **Input Dimensions:** 3 features mapping identically across variables.
- **Linear Architectures:** `nn.Linear(3, 64)`, `nn.Linear(64, 32)` capturing transformations automatically.
- **Activation Bounds:** Standard non-parametric `nn.ReLU()` instances.
- **Outputs:** Final continuous scalar mapping identically `nn.Linear(32, 1)`.

## Mathematical Formulation Summary
Instead of managing weights / biases explicitly mathematically, vectors instantiate automatically initialized randomly encapsulated deep within module definitions continuously tracking dynamic mathematical derivations intrinsically through standard forward structural functions: $\hat{y} = \text{model}(X)$ seamlessly applying $W$ and $b$ calculations seamlessly automatically tracking `autograd` graphs fundamentally.

## Implementation Approach
Subclassing natively from `torch.nn.Module` ensures explicit standardized structures defining exact dimensional parameter counts immediately mapped seamlessly identically across CPU or GPU memory mappings efficiently mapping execution forward functions statically evaluating layers mapping batch sizes accurately across predictions continuously explicitly utilizing external optimizer objects (`torch.optim`).

## Training Procedure Summary
- **Network Pipeline Iteration:** Clean execution loops evaluating batches explicitly mapping `optimizer.zero_grad()`.
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Pre-configured optimization structures seamlessly parsing module parameters continuously (`optim.Adam` / `optim.SGD`) evaluating standard backward pass calculations logically automatically calculating target errors seamlessly via exact `nn.MSELoss()`.
- **Training Stepping Strategies:** Automatic exact updates mapped rapidly `optimizer.step()` adjusting module parameters securely explicitly removing context block manual updates mappings seamlessly.
