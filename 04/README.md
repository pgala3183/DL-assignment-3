*(This video demonstrates code explanation, training output, loss curves, 4D visualization, and GitHub structure overview.)*

## Objective
The objective is to eliminate PyTorch engineering boilerplate securely implementing identical 3-variable continuous nonlinear targets deploying identical architectural components encapsulated natively within the high-level `pytorch_lightning.LightningModule` framework wrapper cleanly predicting outputs robustly.

## Architecture Description
The identical robust Deep Neural Network structures map identically utilizing PyTorch inner components smoothly encapsulated predictably natively mapping:
- **Input Variables:** 3 continuous numeric features.
- **Layers:** `nn.Linear(3, 64)`, `nn.Linear(64, 32)`.
- **Activation Functions:** Standard `nn.ReLU()`.
- **Regression Outcomes:** The continuous output dimensional regression `nn.Linear(32, 1)`.

## Mathematical Formulation Summary
Forward representations securely translate matrices evaluating inputs explicitly calculating $\hat{y} = \text{model}(x)$ intuitively. Mathematical logic regarding chain-rule derivations is explicitly managed securely natively utilizing `autograd`.

## Implementation Approach
Subclassing natively from `pl.LightningModule` eliminates physical training loops entirely cleanly structurally capturing capabilities modularly directly mapping required framework blocks correctly configuring:
1. `__init__`: Network physical structures correctly defined.
2. `forward`: Evaluation paths defining sequential layer logic flawlessly predicting deterministic numeric scalars.
3. `training_step`: Calculation loss logic encapsulating metric execution properly.
4. `configure_optimizers`: Abstracting physical metric updates modularly directly returning optimization blocks.

## Training Procedure Summary
- **Encapsulated Training Logic:** Leverages `pl.Trainer(max_epochs=2000)` automating identical training block iteration loops safely.
- **Parameter Optimization:** Defined directly via intrinsic framework cleanly tracking reliably.
- **Error Processing (Loss):** Standardized regression validation smoothly calculating numeric deviation matrices utilizing `nn.MSELoss()`.

## Visualization Explanation
