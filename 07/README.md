## Objective
The objective integrates identical 3-variable continuous nonlinear targets deploying identical architectural components encapsulated natively within the robust TensorFlow Functional API (`tf.keras.Model`) cleanly predicting robust nonlinear mappings.

## Architecture Description
The Deep Neural structures map cleanly utilizing the Functional API:
- **Input Object:** Explicit instantiation `inputs = Input(shape=(3,))`.
- **Layers:** Functionally evaluated mapping variables cleanly `x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)`, `x = Dense(32, activation='relu')(x)`.
- **Regression Outcomes:** The continuous output dimensional regression `outputs = Dense(1)(x)`.
- **Model Object:** Instantiated securely `model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)`.

## Mathematical Formulation Summary
Functional representations securely translate continuous evaluating inputs explicitly calculating $\hat{y} = \text{model}(x)$ identical natively leveraging internal C++ TensorFlow graph integrations smoothly tracking identical optimizations.
